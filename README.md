OpenNN for Unreal Engine

This is a code plugin for Unreal Engine that integrates the OpenNN software library.

The OpenNN library is not distributed in any manner, and the official github repository
is included as a submodule. Licences for all libraries included and utilized in OpenNN
are available within this repository.

This project has barely started and is not yet functional.
