OpenNN for Unreal Engine

This is a code plugin for Unreal Engine that integrates the OpenNN software library.

The OpenNN library is not distributed in any manner, and the official github repository
is included as a submodule. Licences for all libraries included and utilized in OpenNN
are available within this repository.

This project has barely started and is not yet functional.




Usage:

The main usage of neural networks is for AI, or bot controlled, characters. Unreal Engine already has a framework in place for these and mirror many of the existing structures present in OpenNN.



Usage with AI:

Blackboards hold input data.


BT tasks "do an action"
BT services "update information"

Neural network extrapolates data: BT task
NN decides what to do: BT Service
